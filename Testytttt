Hello Sandeep,

I hope this email finds you well.

We are planning to conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) or testing on the GCP side, and we would appreciate your assistance in a few areas.

Before creating GCP resources, we wanted to run through the plan with you and provide an overview. Here is what we are planning to do:
	•	We have created a pipeline in Harness that will identify long-running Dataproc clusters.
	•	Since the Asset Governance in Harness does not support deletion or stopping actions, we cannot perform these actions directly within Harness.
	•	Therefore, from the Harness pipeline, we will make direct API calls using a GCP service account to perform necessary actions such as deletion or stopping clusters.

For testing purposes, we are planning to update labels on Dataproc clusters instead of performing deletion or any other actions that could lead to accidental changes.

We are currently in touch with the SADA team, who have created a test Dataproc cluster for us in the “bam-metrics-dev” project.

We need your help in creating a service account in our GCP FinOps-as-a-Service project. This service account will have the necessary permissions to update labels on Dataproc clusters and will reside in the GCP FinOps-as-a-Service project. It will perform actions on the “bam-metrics” project.

For authentication between Harness and GCP, we plan to use OIDC connection type.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

Thank you for your support!
