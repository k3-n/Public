Subject: Clarification Needed on Unattached Disks in Projects

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I’ve been trying to reach you for some time but haven’t been able to connect.

We have identified some unattached disks from the projects listed below. It appears that you are the point of contact for these projects. Our automation tool, which runs periodically, is designed to identify and delete these unattached volumes.

However, upon manual inspection, I noticed that these volumes lack our standard exclusion filter, which we communicated to all teams during the One Day 2.0 modernization. Specifically, the CCM action value should be set to ‘false.’ Instead, I observed labels like “do-not-delete” set to ‘true’ on some disks.

Could you please confirm if these disks should indeed be retained? If you wish to exclude them from our automation, you can apply the appropriate exclusion label.

Please let me know your preference at your earliest convenience. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
