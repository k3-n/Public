I’d like to continue growing in my current role by deepening my skills in cloud cost optimization and automation. Over the past year, I’ve really enjoyed working on real, impactful projects like building governance policies and automation pipelines — and I want to take that further. I’m also interested in gradually taking on more ownership, helping others in the team, and learning how to lead cost-efficiency initiatives across a wider scope. Eventually, I’d like to grow into a role where I can influence strategy and support others in building scalable, cost-aware cloud practices.
